# Article Word Count

- Inside the file ["input/article.txt"](input/article.txt) is an article that we would like to know the number of times each word has been shown.

## Your Tasks

### Write codes to:

- Read the file *(I'm not asking you to read the file literally)*

- Perform a count on the number of occurences for each word inside the article

- Output the result on console

## Notes

- This isn't a grammar test. You may ignore abbreviations, hyphenations and most other punctuations. For example, "stove-lids" should be count as two (2) different words "stove" and "lids"; "Samuel L. Jackson" shold be treated as three (3) different words "Samuel", "L" and "Jackson"; "S.O.S." should be counted as three (3) words - two "S" and one "O"

- The only punctuation that you do need to be concerned about is the single quote ('). For example, "can't" should stay as the word "can't" and not "can" and "t"

- The test should be case insensitive. "JObs", "jobs" and "joBS" - total count should be three (3) words as it is the same word.
